* 2 Continuous rotation [servos](http://www.robotshop.com/en/9g-continuous-rotation-micro-servo.html) with [wheels](http://www.robotshop.com/en/24-wheel-micro-continuous-rotation-fs90r-servo.html)
* 1 CDS photoresistor
* 1 Mercury [tilt switch](https://tinkersphere.com/sensors/1012-mercury-tilt-switch-5mm.html)
* 1 ~10KOhm resistor for the photoresistor
* 2X ~220Ohm resistors for the LED and piezo buzzer
* 1 LED
* 1 Battery [Pack](https://www.radioshack.com/products/radioshack-enclosed-4-aaa-battery-holder) and batteries(4 AAA)
* 1 Adafruit Pro Trinket [microcontroller](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2000)
* 1 [Nylon Caster](https://www.amazon.com/Transfer-Conveyor-Transmission-Furniture-Wheelchair/dp/B01F7AND88/ref=pd_sim_328_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01F7AND88&pd_rd_r=25N3Y83XW0QCW34XFGD8&pd_rd_w=IquxZ&pd_rd_wg=j7hVD&psc=1&refRID=25N3Y83XW0QCW34XFGD8)
* 1 Full size [Breadboard](http://tinkersphere.com/breadboarding/1094-full-size-breadboard-830-tie-point.html) (830 tie points)
* 1 Piezo [Buzzer](http://tinkersphere.com/buzzers/1339-piezo-buzzer-5vac-breadboard-compatible.html)
* M2M jumper wires
* 2 long 3 pin headers to connect 2 servos to a breadboard
* Two sided VHB tape to hold the caster to the bottom of the breadboard
* Quick drying epoxy glue to hold the battery pack and servos to the breadboard
